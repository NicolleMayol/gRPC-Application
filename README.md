### Networking

The project infrastructure is built on Amazon Web Services (AWS) and consists of the following components:

#### Virtual Private Cloud (VPC):
Provides isolated networking environment for our resources.
* CIDR Block: 10.0.0.0/16
#### Subnets:
`Public Subnets:`
Hosts resources accessible from the internet.
* CIDR Blocks: 10.0.3.0/24, 10.0.4.0/24

`Private Subnet:`
Hosts resources that require internal communication only.
* CIDR Block: 10.0.2.0/24
#### Internet Gateway (IGW):
Facilitates internet connectivity for resources in public subnets.
* Route Tables:
    * Public Route Table:
            Routes internet-bound traffic to the IGW.
#### Security Groups:
* Allow All:
    Controls inbound and outbound traffic for resources.
#### Amazon EKS Cluster:
Managed Kubernetes service for containerized applications.
* Cluster Name: simetrik-cluster
* Version: 1.24
#### Application Ingress (ALB):
Acts as the entry point for incoming traffic to our application.
Listens on port 50051 and routes traffic to the EKS cluster.
#### CI/CD Pipeline (AWS CodeBuild):
Automates the build and deployment process of the application to the EKS cluster.
Integrates with the version control system (CodeCommit)
Automates the deployment process of the infrastructure
